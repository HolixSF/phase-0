**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

	On the github website once you are logged in you can create a repo by clicking the "+" sign on the top right of the page and it will give a dropdown for you to choose to create a new repo.
	Once you are in the next page you will be asked to name your repo, make it either public or private, and have the option to choose to have a README and to have a license added to you repo.
	Click the "create repository" button on the bottom and you just created your first repo!
	Once you are in your repository you can then copy the link to it on the right side of the page and head to your computer and into your terminal.
	You can then navigate your way into your preffered directory and type in "git clone <insert URL of the link you just copied here>".
	Now you have your repo on github and a clone of it on your system!.

**Describe what open source means.**
	
	Open Source is the sharing of the source code of programs.
	It allows anyone access to the code of any program and the user the ability to change it or do anything else with it.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

	Depending on what type of program is made, it definitely can feel like a double edged sword.
	You do need to be wary of others taking your work and creating bad programs or using them for the wrong reasons.
	At the same time if people are making things better or helping you with your program that can be a good thing.
	It also serves as a pot of ideas from multiple people and opens your mind to things you wouldnt normally think of.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

	Just like what I explained above with being wary of others using your work, having certain licenses protects you and your projects. Licenses give certain restrictions on the work you have produced so that others are not taking them for themselves or using them for bad practice. It also serves as a check and balance when it comes to buying and or selling programs.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

	By going through the process of creating "feature-branches" multiple times and doing pull requests and merging them back to master, I was able to understand the steps alot more clearly. Some commands are now sticking to my head so that Iam more fluid in writing them. At first I was struggling with knowing when to create the "feature-branch" but as I went along I understood the reasoning more clearly.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
