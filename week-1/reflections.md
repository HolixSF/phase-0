## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
	I learned a lot about time boxing, making good and small habits, and also how to get in the zone and find your flow.

	Time Boxing is a technique where you set a time to complete a goal. Whether or not you finish that goal you will stop and reflect on what was accomplished. The same as the pomodoro technique in which you set 25min intervals on the goals you want to accomplish. 

	I manage my time by setting goals for myself to do for the day. I try not to overburden myself at first and only set a certain amount. If I find that I accomplished all of my goals with ease and with time to spare I will add more the next time. I am constantly adjusting how much I plan to do and I tend to have a good grasp on what I can and cant accomplish on a daily basis.

	My current strategy is working for me because I have learned a lot about myself and what I can get done through years of trial and error. In a sense I guess I am using the Time Box technique without knowing it. I have just catered it to fit my environment and the goals I wish to accomplish.

	I would like to employ more small habits in order to be more organized with my work. I also want to be able to get in the zone at will so that I am super focused and have no distractions.

	My overall plan is to tackle to challenges one at a time until I am comfortable doing more a day. It will be trial and error but I want to maximize my time well and complete them without worry.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
	**What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

	A shell is an interface, like the command line, that takes commands and interprets it to the operating system. "Bash" is a shell program that takes in commands and interprets it to a unix type operating system.

	**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

	The most challenging for me was learning how the "pushd" and "popd" commands actually worked. It was a bit confusing but with more practice I will understand it better. I also found the "env" command and going into PATH to be a bit confusing. I needed to search online for more understanding.

	**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

	Yes. By memorizing the commands as the author stated, it makes it a lot easier and fluid to understand how to use them. 

	**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

	I believe that "ls" is a must since it lists all the files and directories. "cd" is also very important since it is your main tool in moving through all the directories. Also, "man" gives you a manual of anything and helps when you don't understand or are stuck. The "wild card" argument is important as it lets you find things a lot easier when looking for anything.

	**Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**  

	**-pwd** This stands for "Print working directory" and lets you see what directory you are currently in. 

	**-ls** This stands for "List" and prints out the directories or files under which you are currently in.

	**-mv** This stands for "Move" and allows you to move files or directories to others.

	**-cd** This stands for "Change directory" and allows you to navigate through different files and directories.

	**-../** This goes lets you move up the path to the previous directory or file.

	**-touch** This is the command to create a new file.

	**-mkdir** This is the command to create a new directory. It stands for "Make directory".

	**-less** This command lets you view files and page through them.

	**-rmdir** This command, which stands for "Remove directory", lets you remove or delete directories.

	**-rm** This command lets you remove or delete files and directories and works almost like rmdir

	**-help** This basically gives you information for the argument.

## 1.3 Forking and Cloning Reflection
	**If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**

	Considering the user has git installed and has a github account.. We would start at the github website and navigate to the top right where the + sign is. From there we can create a new repo. Once that repo is made and we navigate to that repo we can again go to the top right and look for "Fork" in order to fork that repo. To clone that repo to our computer we can navigate to the right of the github repo screen and look for a link we can copy. On our computer we go the directory we want to copy the repo to and type "git clone <insert url link of repo>". This will create a copy or clone of the repo on our computer. Forking a repository instead of creating a new one allows multiple people to work on the same project and make changes without affecting the original.

	**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**

	Learning the right commands and organizing your directories were hard at first but going through them one by one helped me understand what commands did what and where/which directory I was in and supposed to be in. Knowing to use the command line to do everything really helps me understand how everything else works because most commands are similar even with the different programs used.
