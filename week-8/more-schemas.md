<!-- REFLECTION -->

What is a one-to-one database?

	When something is related to another in only one way from both sides.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

	When there is only one of something.

What is a many-to-many database?

	When something has a lot of things and those things are related to many other things.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

	When I need to organize alot of things related to alot of other things.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

	At this point the confusing part is the connecting IDs and keys. What makes sense is how they are connected and what is included in each table.
