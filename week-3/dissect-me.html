			<h4>What is Git?</h4>
			Git is a type of version control system. Git helps you keep track of changes as you are working on a file or project. When you input Git commands during your work, you are essentially take snapshots of all the changes you made during that time and it stores the changes you made into a local repository.

			<h4>What is GitHub</h4>
			Github is a tool that lets multiple people using Git work on the same project. It keeps track of changes made across multiple repositories and enforces a push-and-pull check system for approving changes made to a project. In both Git and Github, there is an opportunity for the project creator to see details on what changes happened, where it happened, when it happened, and who caused it to happen.

<!-- REFLECTION TIIIMEEE

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	I have been using header and also section. They are the ones I understand the most.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	They get laid out by wrapping them in the appropriate tags that the browser interprets. The browser checks to see what type of document it is then moves on to the header then the body and last the footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	I learned some handy shortcuts and also creating snippets which is like a macro for code. I will definitely create more snippets to help me be more efficient.
	I will do some research right now on snippets that I can use!
