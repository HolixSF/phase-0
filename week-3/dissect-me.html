			<h4>What is GitHub</h4>
			Github is a tool that lets multiple people using Git work on the same project. It keeps track of changes made across multiple repositories and enforces a push-and-pull check system for approving changes made to a project. In both Git and Github, there is an opportunity for the project creator to see details on what changes happened, where it happened, when it happened, and who caused it to happen.
