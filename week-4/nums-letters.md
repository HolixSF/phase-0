**What does puts do?**

```"puts" stands for put string and it lets you output something to the console but does not return any information.```

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

```An integer is a number with no decimals. A float is a number with decimals.```

**What is the difference between float and integer 
division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

```When dealing with a integers during division, it always rounds down. Say if you were to go to the movies and you had $9. The movie is $2 to see. You can say that your able to watch a movie 4 times but whatevers left over is not enough and you cant watch half of a movie or only let half of you to watch. When dealing with floats you are able to get a much more accurate number during division.```

**-----Reflection!!!-----**

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

```Ruby handles them just like a calculator would but only calculates numbers as integers unless you tell it to calculate as a float.```

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**

```An integer is a number with no decimals and a float is a number with decimals.```

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**

```Integer division rounds down its answers and float division gives you a decimal answer.```

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

```A string is a group of letters in a program that can have punctuation, digits, symbols, and spaces in them. A string is identified between qoutation marks. It can also be an empty string with nothing in it.```

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

```A way to name a string or a number is to assign it a variable. A variable is identified as a name with its first character in lowercase. Ex. my_name = "Luis". my_name is the variable and "Luis" is the string.```

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

```It was a good review and I was able to grasp the concepts better than before!```
