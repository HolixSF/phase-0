- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

	It was awesome! I got to see the fruits of my labor haha. Getting to put everything together and see the result is great. Now I want to make it look nice!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

	I will be honest and did not do much research besides the codeacademy course I had taken. I did read the article on tables and divs but it seemed very complex with adding different styles and elements. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	
	I did very well in keeping lines and annotations organized. I edited a bunch of times just to get it the way I want.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

	It seems like HTML is basic format of how a website should look and helps with building without the distractions of styling. The bad thing is it doesnt look very good by itself and makes for a bad user experience.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	
	Remembering the tags and what they do. The tags are easy to memorize as they usually start with the letter of what they mean. Also knowing where things need to be nested. The basic format of DOCTYPE, Html, Head, and Body to start.
